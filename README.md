# Introduction
Implementing a column generation scheme to solve large variants of Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW)

#Scripts
To that end, we have the following modules:
- 
* `instance_generator.py`: generating random CVRPTW instance for given customer size.
* `column_generation.py`: implementing column generation procedure for the relaxed VRP instance.
* `branch_and_price.py`: implementing a branch and price algorithm for the VRP instnce.
